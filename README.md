# Vulkan Tutorial
I am following a vulkan tutorial on youtube, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr93-_cC8v4&list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR&index=2).

There are some coding style things that I don't agree with, and sometimes I'll change things depending on my own feelings.

## Video 1 - Introduction 
No notes; pretty simple stuff, create a window etc. Good start!

## Video 2 - Graphics Pipeline Overview
Learned about the graphics pipeline, which parts of it are configurable and what a shader is. Implemented and compiled an extremely simple shader using glsl.

Very interesting! I'm excited to learn more about all of this stuff, we'll see when the anxiety and/or ADHD hits ðŸ˜…
