# Vulkan Tutorial
I am following a vulkan tutorial on youtube, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr93-_cC8v4&list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR&index=2).

There are some coding style things that I don't agree with, and sometimes I'll change things depending on my own feelings.

## Video 1 - Introduction 
No notes; they set up a build environment using vscode on macos which I am not going to use.

## Video 2 - Create a Window
Created a window for our thing to live in!

## Video 2 - Graphics Pipeline Overview
Learned about the graphics pipeline, which parts of it are configurable and what a shader is. Implemented and compiled an extremely simple shader using glsl.

Very interesting! I'm excited to learn more about all of this stuff, we'll see when the anxiety and/or ADHD hits ðŸ˜…

## Video 3 - Device Setup
Learned how to contact the graphics device, and set up a kind of interface (?) to it. This video was hard to grok, partly because it relied on downloading a bunch of boilerplate code. I do think is the right call by mr Galea (the author of the tutorial series) because there was quite a bit of it and doing all of this setup was already a bit challenging. It is also a bit tricky to keep track of all the components since it isn't trivial to understand how they will all interact in the final product.

## Video 4 - Fixed Function Pipeline Stages
Configured the fixed function pipeline stages. The configuration pattern of creating structs and passing them to Vulkan is a bit foreign but intuitive - I wish the tutorial would have taken the time to explain the division of responsibility a bit more here, it feels as though we're setting up something that is the way we want it but skipping past the naÃ¯ve approach of just hard-setting things first. Maybe things will become a bit clearer, but this video was a lot of typing with a bit less understanding even though I looked up the concepts and skipped back whenever I missed something.

I also figured out a game I might want to make! More on that in another repo. Maybe.

## Video 5 - Swap Chain Overview
I now understand a tiny bit about swap chains, image buffers and difference image buffer modes - or at least the existence of them. All the errors are now gone, and the code opens... an empty window! Yay!

## Video 6 - Command Buffers Overview
Most of this may have gone over my head; command buffers are a way of structuring commands in our calls to the GPU, and "recording" commands so that they can be reused on subsequent passes. At the end, at least we drew a red triangle! Then changed it to be magenta.

## Video 7 - Vertex Buffers
Vertex buffers are groups of vertex attributes, where different vertex attributes (position, RGB values etc) are placed in buffers. We must "bind" vertex buffers descriptions to the graphics pipeline, defining stride etc. This is done in a "Vertex Attribute Description" that contains the binding, location, offset and format. Whether buffers should be interleaved or separate, depends on the implementation.
In this tutorial, we will allocate memory ourselves - that's to do with all the `nullptr` we've been passing in everywhere. But for serious projects, one probably wants to use a memory allocation library such as VMA.
