# Vulkan Tutorial
I am following a vulkan tutorial on youtube, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr93-_cC8v4&list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR&index=2).

There are some coding style things that I don't agree with, and sometimes I'll change things depending on my own feelings.

## Video 1 - Introduction 
No notes; they set up a build environment using vscode on macos which I am not going to use.

## Video 2 - Create a Window
Created a window for our thing to live in!

## Video 2 - Graphics Pipeline Overview
Learned about the graphics pipeline, which parts of it are configurable and what a shader is. Implemented and compiled an extremely simple shader using glsl.

Very interesting! I'm excited to learn more about all of this stuff, we'll see when the anxiety and/or ADHD hits 😅

## Video 3 - Device Setup
Learned how to contact the graphics device, and set up a kind of interface (?) to it. This video was hard to grok, partly because it relied on downloading a bunch of boilerplate code. I do think is the right call by mr Galea (the author of the tutorial series) because there was quite a bit of it and doing all of this setup was already a bit challenging. It is also a bit tricky to keep track of all the components since it isn't trivial to understand how they will all interact in the final product.
